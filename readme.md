# City Path Finder

## Project Description

City Path Finder is a web application that utilizes the A\* and Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) algorithms to determine the optimal route between cities. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of these pathfinding algorithms with a user-friendly interface.
